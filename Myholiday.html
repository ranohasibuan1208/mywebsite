                <p>Hallo, my name is <strong>Rano Rionaldo Abed Nego Hasibuan</strong>. Here I will tell you about the most effective things I did during last semester's holidays. namely my and a close friend's trip to a waterfall and tea garden on Shabbath.</p>

                <p>On Sabbath afternoon at the chapel, my friend said and invited me to go to the waterfall and tea garden. There I refused the invitation, but when I thought about it, I also felt bored in the room and had nothing else to do on that Sabbath. After arriving at the waterfall I was very happy and happy because I could see the beautiful view of the waterfall and the freshness of nature as well as many events that made me laugh with my friends. One of them was that my friend slipped from a bridge.</p>

                <p>I felt quite satisfied with a memorable Sabbath afternoon trip with friends, we were able to start in a group and go home as a group, but on the way home the rain came down and poured on us until we were soaked but we enjoyed the rain that fell. After this incident we arrived physically tired but happy at heart, then we returned to our respective homes and carried out our usual activities for the sake of eternal survival.</p>
